Real devices come with a great value and benefits, but also with their own costs. Mobile simulators and emulators can offer valuable benefits for both developers and testers, but it's worth noting that they also have limitations.

## Emulators and Simulators

In mobile testing, an __emulator__ is a software that mimics the functionality of a real Android device and allows you to test your app on it. An emulator mimics the hardware and OS of the device. 
A __simulator__, on the other hand, is a virtual device for testing iOS apps on a Mac host, such as simulating the behavior of an iPhone or iPad.

Emulators provide an operating environment that closely resembles the functionality and capabilities of a mobile device model, like:
- Emulated incoming phone calls and text messages.
- Various network speeds.
- Location services
- Device orientation and rotation.
- Hardware sensors.

Simulators can be useful for early testing of iOS apps by creating a simulated environment that mimics the functionality of a specific mobile device model. However, it's important to note that simulators have limitations and should not be relied upon for testing of hardware components, gestures, or real-world user scenarios. They are best for lightweight functional testing.

__Emulators vs. Simulators__

An emulator is a desktop app that completely virtualizes all aspects of a real device, including both the hardware and OS. Simulators donâ€™t mimic the hardware or OS. They allow the user to validate application flows, but not in a true production environment.

## Real Devices

Using real devices in mobile testing enables you to test your app on actual hardware, providing an accurate representation of how it performs in a customer's hands. This is useful for ensuring the app's functionality and compatibility on various devices.

## Real Devices vs. Emulators vs. Simulators

The discussion surrounding the use of real devices, emulators, and simulators for mobile testing has been a longstanding and contentious topic in the mobile industry.

__Emulators and simulators__ are best for testing in the early stages of development. Emulators are more suitable for testing external behavior, and simulators for internal behavior.

Testing on __real devices__ provides the most reliable results and is ideal for usability and performance testing. It also allows for more realistic testing by applying real-world conditions and user scenarios.
